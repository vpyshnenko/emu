# Emu Causality Theory  
## Chapter 4 — Criticality and Stability of Causal Expansion

Building on the geometric model of avalanches (Depth, Width, Volume, Expansion Rate),  
we now analyze when causal expansion is stable, terminating, or divergent.

This chapter connects Emu avalanche dynamics to branching-process intuition,
while remaining fully deterministic.

## 1. Local Expansion Factor

Recall the per-generation expansion factor:

    λₖ = |Gₖ₊₁| / |Gₖ|    (if |Gₖ| > 0)

This measures the average number of events generated by each event at depth k.

Interpretation:

- λₖ < 1  → contraction
- λₖ = 1  → steady propagation
- λₖ > 1  → expansion

However, Emu is deterministic — so λₖ is not a probabilistic expectation,
but an exact ratio for that avalanche.

---

## 2. Global Average Expansion

Define:

    λ_avg = (TotalEmitted) / (TotalDelivered)

Equivalently:

    λ_avg = (Σₖ |Gₖ₊₁|) / (Σₖ |Gₖ|)

This represents the average branching factor across the entire avalanche.

It captures overall amplification.

---

## 3. Subcritical, Critical, and Supercritical Regimes

We classify avalanche regimes analogously to branching processes:

### 3.1 Subcritical Regime

If:

    λ_avg < 1

Then:

- Causal expansion contracts on average.
- Generations eventually shrink.
- Avalanche must terminate (assuming finite state and bounded emission).

This is a stable regime.

---

### 3.2 Critical Regime

If:

    λ_avg = 1

Then:

- Each generation replaces itself on average.
- Depth may grow large.
- Termination depends on structure.

In cyclic topologies, critical systems may:
- Terminate,
- Oscillate,
- Or diverge depending on state evolution.

Criticality represents a boundary of stability.

---

### 3.3 Supercritical Regime

If:

    λ_avg > 1

Then:

- Expansion amplifies on average.
- Width tends to grow.
- Divergence is possible or likely in cyclic graphs.

This is an unstable regime.

---

## 4. Deterministic vs Probabilistic Branching

Unlike classical branching processes:

- Emu has no randomness.
- Expansion is state-dependent.
- δ functions may alter behavior over time.

Thus λₖ may vary with depth.

Stability depends not only on averages,
but on structural constraints.

---

## 5. Structural Stability Conditions

Termination is guaranteed if:

1. The routing graph is acyclic, and
2. Each δₙ emits a bounded number of outputs.

In this case:

- Depth is bounded by graph height.
- Width is bounded.
- Volume is finite.

Even if λₖ > 1 locally, the avalanche cannot diverge.

---

## 6. Cycles and Sustained Expansion

In cyclic topologies:

- Events may re-enter previously visited nodes.
- State may sustain emission.

Divergence occurs if:

- There exists a cycle in the routing graph,
- And δ maintains non-zero emission along that cycle,
- And contraction does not occur.

Sustained λₖ ≥ 1 along a cycle implies potential non-termination.

---

## 7. Stability via Contraction

A stronger stability criterion:

If there exists N such that for all k ≥ N:

    λₖ < 1

Then:

- Width eventually decreases.
- Horizon collapses.
- Avalanche terminates.

This is asymptotic contraction.

---

## 8. Memory Stability

Memory usage correlates with:

    MaxWidth ≈ MaxQueueSize

Therefore:

- Subcritical systems exhibit bounded memory.
- Supercritical systems may exhibit unbounded memory growth.

Width stability is as important as depth stability.

---

## 9. Fixed-Point Perspective

An avalanche terminates when:

    G_D ≠ ∅ and G_{D+1} = ∅

This represents a fixed point:

- No further emissions are generated.
- Causal expansion reaches equilibrium.

Thus termination corresponds to:

> A zero-expansion state of the causal wave.

---

## 10. Criticality as Design Parameter

In practical system design:

- λ_avg < 1 → damped signal propagation.
- λ_avg ≈ 1 → sustained propagation.
- λ_avg > 1 → amplification.

Thus Emu networks can be tuned:

- As filters (subcritical),
- As propagators (critical),
- As amplifiers (supercritical).

This gives a quantitative design framework.

---

## 11. Summary

Avalanche stability depends on:

- Expansion factors λₖ
- Topology (acyclic vs cyclic)
- State evolution in δ
- Boundedness of emissions

The stability regime determines:

- Termination behavior
- Memory growth
- Divergence geometry

Emu therefore admits a precise classification:

> Subcritical, critical, and supercritical causal systems.

This completes the foundational causal dynamics framework.
